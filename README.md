# Code Climate Style Guides

A consistent style is important in a code base. Inconsistency greatly increases
the number of inconsequential decisions developers must make. Consistency is
good for readability and a clean code base promotes keeping a code base clean.
It is more important, and ultimately will make you happier, to abide by a
defined style and end up in a consistent code base, than to code in your own
preferred style and not.
